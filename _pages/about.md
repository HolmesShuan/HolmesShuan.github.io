I am an algorithm engineer specializing in E-commerce search at Meituan (美团) as of August 2024. My research spans a broad spectrum of topics including computer vision and deep learning-based model compression. Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to advancing autonomous driving through visual perception. Then, I shifted my focus to generative search utilizing large language models (LLM).

Previously, I worked on high-performance computing for deep neural networks on edge devices during my internship at [Maicro](https://www.maicro.com/). Currently, I am exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Inclusive Education.

I earned my Ph.D. from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) in 2022, under the esteemed guidance of Prof. [Jian Cheng](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chengjian). I received my B.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2017.
