I am currently the co-founder of [FunAmi AI](https://funami.cn/#about), a company dedicated to promoting inclusive education through artificial intelligence (AI). Previously, I worked as an algorithm engineer specializing in E-commerce search at [Meituan (美团)](https://www.meituan.com/en-US/about-us). My research covers a wide range of topics, including computer vision and deep learning-based model compression. Throughout my career, I have been committed to advancing [autonomous driving](https://mad.meituan.com/) through visual perception. Then, I shifted my focus to generative search utilizing large language models (LLM) for various reasons.

I worked on high-performance computing for deep neural networks on edge devices during my internship at [Maicro](https://www.maicro.com/). This included the development of neural network inference frameworks on ARM chips and the algorithm verification of the [Quantized Neural Process Unit (QNPU)](http://www.semiinsights.com/s/foundry/33/36933.shtml).

I earned my Ph.D. from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) in 2022, under the esteemed guidance of Prof. [Jian Cheng](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chengjian). I received my B.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2017.
